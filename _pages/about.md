I am a Ram√≥n y Cajal Fellow at the [Institute of Public Goods and Policies (IPP)](https://ipp.csic.es/en) at the [Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es/en). Before joining IPP-CSIC, I have worked as an associate professor in political science at [Carlos III University of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home), as well as an assistant professor in political science at the [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/political-science/), where I organized the [Experimental Politics Lab](https://experimentalpolitics.github.io/). I received my PhD in political science from [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/). My research focuses on the psychological underpinnings of political attitudes, reasoning, and behavior. I am especially interested in the development and application of new statistical methods in the area of political psychology. For example, I use quantitative text analysis to study how citizens discuss and justify their political preferences and beliefs in open-ended survey responses as well as online discussions.

<!-- Outside of academia, I enjoy cycling, hiking, climbing, and photography. I am also a fan of the German card game [Skat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_%28card_game%29). Here's a little [Shiny app](http://pwkraft.shinyapps.io/Skat) that keeps track of our group's game statistics. -->
