I am a visiting professor and (starting 2023) a Ramón y Cajal Fellow at the [Juan March Institute of Social Sciences](https://ic3jm.es/en/) at [University Carlos III of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Home). I am also an affiliated faculty in political science at the [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/political-science/) and organizer of the [Experimental Politics Lab](https://experimentalpolitics.github.io/) at the department. I received my PhD in political science from [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/). My research focuses on the psychological underpinnings of political attitudes, reasoning, and behavior. I am especially interested in the development and application of new statistical methods in the area of political psychology. For example, I use quantitative text analysis to study how citizens discuss and justify their political preferences and beliefs in open-ended survey responses as well as online discussions.

Outside of academia, I enjoy cycling, hiking, climbing, and photography. I am also a fan of the German card game [Skat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_%28card_game%29). Here's a little [Shiny app](http://pwkraft.shinyapps.io/Skat) that keeps track of our group's game statistics.
